LeetCode 725 – Split Linked List in Parts

Problem Statement

Given the head of a singly linked list and an integer `k`, split the linked list into `k` consecutive linked list parts.

Rules:

The length of each part should be as equal as possible
The size difference between any two parts should be at most 1
Earlier parts must be greater than or equal in sizecompared to later parts
Some parts may be null if the list has fewer nodes than `k`

---

Approach

1.Count the total number of nodes in the linked list.
2. Calculate:

   * `baseSize = length / k` → minimum nodes in each part
   * `extra = length % k` → first `extra` parts get one extra node
3. Traverse the list and:

   * Assign nodes to each part based on the calculated size
   * Break the link after each part to form independent lists
4. Store each part in an array of size `k`.

This ensures:

* Balanced splitting
* Correct order
* Valid handling of null parts

Java Solution

/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode[] splitListToParts(ListNode head, int k) {

        // Step 1: Calculate the length of the linked list
        int len = 0;
        ListNode temp = head;
        while (temp != null) {
            len++;
            temp = temp.next;
        }

        // Step 2: Determine base size and remainder
        int baseSize = len / k;
        int extra = len % k;

        // Step 3: Result array
        ListNode[] result = new ListNode[k];
        ListNode curr = head;

        // Step 4: Split the list
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            if (curr == null) {
                result[i] = null;
                continue;
            }

            result[i] = curr;
            int partSize = baseSize + (extra > 0 ? 1 : 0);
            if (extra > 0) extra--;

            // Move to the end of the current part
            for (int j = 1; j < partSize; j++) {
                curr = curr.next;
            }

            // Break the link
            ListNode next = curr.next;
            curr.next = null;
            curr = next;
        }

        return result;
    }
}
 Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: `O(n)`
Space Complexity: `O(1)` (excluding output array)
Key Takeaways

Always return exactly `k` parts
First `length % k` parts get one extra node
Breaking links is essential to form separate lists
Works correctly even when `k > length`
